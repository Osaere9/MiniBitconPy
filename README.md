## 📚 Understanding the Basics

### What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a digital ledger that records transactions across many computers. This ensures that the recorded information is secure, transparent, and cannot be altered without consensus from the network.

### What is Proof-of-Work?

Proof-of-Work is a method used to confirm transactions and produce new blocks in a blockchain. It requires computational effort and helps secure the network from attacks.
